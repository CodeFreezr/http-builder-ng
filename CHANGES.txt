Now using JsonBuilder instead of json-lib.

HTTPBuilder.createClient no longer exists. To change the underlying http client, pass it to the constructor.

HTTPBuilder.getClient() is now final; HTTPBuilder.setClient() has been removed.

AsyncHTTPBuilder.finalize() no longer exists, use AutoCloseable for automatic resource management.
